/**
 * - LeetCode : https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/
 * - clarification:
 *   k = 1.
 *
 * - solutions:
 *   1. Change the links between the nodes in k-group during the recursion,
 *      everytime the last node is the head of the reversed group
 *      which should returned to the upper level of the recursion,
 *      and the first node is the tail of the the reversed group.
 *      After we get the return value from the lower level, we should link the tail to it.
 *      Time complexity: O(n)
 *      Space complexity: O(n) occupied by the recursion stack.
 *   2. Change the links between the nodes during the iteration, using the pointers to remember the position.
 *      `preTail`: the tail of previous group
 *      `curTail`: the tail of current group
 *      The tail should link the first node of the group.
 *      Time complexity: O(n)
 *      Space complexity: O(1)

 * - Test cases:
 *   1. [1,2] , k = 1
 *   2. [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
 *   3. [1,4,5,2,7,8,9,0], k = 3
 *
 * - Important key:
 *   We have to use pointers carefully in case we lose or change some references without knowing it.
 *
