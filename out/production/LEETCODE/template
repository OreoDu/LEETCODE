  * 1. confirm the question
  * 2. explain the thoughts --- talk while thinking and explain the solution with some keywords
  *       (15 min)              try the solution by using case and explain it
  *                             explain the time and space complexity!!!
  * 3. write the code and remember to write down the comments(15 min)
  * 4. test the case (use special cases)
  * 5. the whole process should be in 45min!
  * 6. clam down and avoid small syntax mistakes!!! (write code on the white board and pay attention the special case!!!)
