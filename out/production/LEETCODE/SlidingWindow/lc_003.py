### Important key: Using different data structure to represent sliding window.
#                  Different ways to update the start of the sliding window.  
    
# The origunal solution which is not very good.
# Store the whole substring in the list until meet the character which has already been in the substring.
# The runing time is pretty slow because I deleted all the elements in the list every time and have some repeating steps(add the same elements)
